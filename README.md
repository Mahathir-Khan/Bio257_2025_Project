The project focuses on articulating connections between 16s microbiome observations for patients with AD and bulk RNAseq data from the hippocampus of AD patients. We anticipate seeing connections between increased inflammation in the gut and increased inflammation in the brain via a gut-brain axis. Since we are operating with entirely separate datasets, our conclusions are exploratory in nature. We are also looking at cell-specific behavior in the brain to see if any specific observations can be made for AD patients.
